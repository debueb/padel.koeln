# DB Migrations

By default all maven profiles have the Hibernate "hbm2ddl.auto" 
property set to "update", which means that trivial SQL statements, such as field 
or table additions triggered by means of JPA or Hibernate annotations are generated 
and executed by Hibernate automatically upon application start. However, the 
Hibernate update mechanims is limited to only support secure operations. That means 
that you will have to write custom SQL scripts containing UPDATE, DELETE, ALTER or other 
statements that change the DB to the desired state. Simply put these SQL scripts 
in the src/main/resources/db/migration folder and adhere to the FlywayDB naming 
conventions: http://flywaydb.org/documentation/migration/sql.html.
Scripts within the migration folder will be executed AFTER any automatic Hibernate statements.
